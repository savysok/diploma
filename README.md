## Thesis project for N.T.U.A.
###### by Spyros Kosyvas

This is my thesis project for the N.T.U.A. It is an experimentantion on creating a standalone architectural design program using exclusively open-source programs. It is inspired among other things by modular design and computer games.

The main idea was the creation of an architectural design program targeted at people not familiar with CAD (Computer Assisted Design/Drawing) type programs and allow them to create buildings using parts of buildings, such as walls, floors and furniture/appliances. The logic behind the building system is that of Lego/Froebel blocks: creating through the use of pre-defined building parts.

The project is currently a work-in-progress and under contstruction.

### Features:

- **modular building system**: create buildings from pre-modeled pieces

- **"_point and click_"**: placement of the modular pieces with the click of a button

- **dynamic loading of models**: import your models blend file in the "models" subfolder and it will appear in the program next time you start it
