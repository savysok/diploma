## Thesis project for N.T.U.A.
###### by Spyros Kosyvas

This project is my thesis project for the N.T.U.A.

The main idea is the creation of an architectural design program targeted at people not familiar with CAD (Computer Assisted Design/Drawing) type programs and allow them to create buildings using parts of famous buildings. The logic behind the building system is that of Lego/Froebel blocks/Minecraft: creating through the use of pre-determined building parts.

The project is currently under contstruction.

### Features:

- **modular building system**: create buildings from pre-modeled pieces

- **"_point and click_"**: placement of the modular pieces with the click of a button

- **dynamic loading of models**: import your models blend file in the "models" subfolder and it will appear in the program next time you start it

More info coming soon..
